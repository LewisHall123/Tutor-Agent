# Tutor-Agent
LLM powered tutor to help you study and track progress on the material you are studying. 

The reason I am making this is because I am studying machine learning and I want an AI agent that can help me learn. It is written in Python, using LangChain, and the OpenAI API.

Core functionality of the agent: 
- Test the users knowledge based off their own set of notes by asking them questions on the contents of these notes.
- Mark  their answers on each set of questions it gives them. 
- Update a progress report that shows what topics the student struggles with to help inform the tutor what to test the student on.

# Tutor-Agent
LLM powered tutor to help you study and track progress on the material you are studying. 

This is a hobby project in its early stages, it is not yet ready to be used by the public, hence why much of the code is currently incomplete. The reason I am making this is because I am studying machine learning and I want an AI agent that can help me learn. It is written in Python, using LangChain, and the OpenAI API.

Core functionality of the agent: 
- Test my knowlwdge based off my own set of notes by asking me questions on the contents of these notes.
- Grade my answers on each set of questions it gives me, log the grade and the date the questions were answered.
- Display what grades I have been getting on each topic.
- Schedule what topics I should learn each day so that I study each topic at specific time intervals.
- Let the user specify which topics are most important so the sytem proritises these topics in the schedule.
- Let the user specify how much time he wants to spend studying today, the agent then automatically starts the study session.
